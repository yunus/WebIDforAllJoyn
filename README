WebID android library for AllJoyn.

WebID is a single sign on standard, and AllJoyn helps you create a proximity based 
peer2peer network without dealing with communication interfaces.
When you combine the two you get social devices.

Devices have their own x509 certificates and web profiles. In the web profiles 
they declare their owners. And by using the social networks of the owners of the devices
services in AllJoyn are authenticated.

And this library does it :). In AllJoyn RSA based key exchange mechanism for authentication.
It uses X509 certificates. But it leaves the verification of the certificates to the application developers.
At this point, our library comes into play. We "verify" the certificate by checking the 
public key information at the web profile (see WebID) and then "validate" 
the trust connection.

For the time being you have to select which type of social network search that you want.

"ActAsHuman" : certificate belongs to human
"ActAsDevice" : certificate belongs to device itself and the devices have the same owner.
"DirectTrust" : certificate belongs to device itself and the devices owners are direct friends.
"InDirectTrust" : certificate belongs to device itself and the devices owners are indirect friends, namely they have a common friend.


The code is highly experimental (implemented in two days). Use with your own risk. You can ask me before using it.
